# WorkLog Module
Module that contains functions that allow you to manage working with 'Work Log' markdown files

I created this module to quickly give me the ability to do basic file management for the markdown files I use for daily Work Logs, including getting the status/patch of the current Work Log file, creating a new Work Log file and adding new entries to the current Work Log file.

Functions include:
* ``Get-WorkLog``
* ``New-WorkLog``
* ``Add-WorkLog``
